MessageStorage Smart Contract

Overview
The MessageStorage smart contract allows users to store a personal message on the blockchain and retrieve it later. Messages are stored securely and can only be retrieved by the user who stored them. The contract enforces a limit of 100 characters per message to ensure efficient storage.

Features
Users can store a single message associated with their Ethereum address.
Only the user who stored a message can retrieve it.
Messages are limited to a maximum of 100 characters.
Implements basic error handling for invalid inputs or missing messages.
Requirements
Solidity Version: ^0.8.0
Ethereum Wallet: Compatible with wallets like MetaMask.
Development Environment: Tools like Remix IDE or frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle.
Contract Functions
1. storeMessage
Purpose: Allows a user to store a message.

Parameters:
newMessage (string): The message to be stored. Must be 100 characters or fewer.
Usage:
solidity
Copy code
storeMessage("Hello, Blockchain!");
Constraints:
The message length must be â‰¤ 100 characters.
2. retrieveMessage
Purpose: Allows the user to retrieve their stored message.

Returns:
A string containing the stored message.
Usage:
solidity
Copy code
retrieveMessage(); // Returns: "Hello, Blockchain!"
Constraints:
The user must have previously stored a message.
Deployment
Open the contract in your preferred Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix).
Compile the contract using Solidity version ^0.8.0.
Deploy the contract to a supported Ethereum network (e.g., Testnet or Mainnet).
Interact with the contract using the functions provided.
Example Workflow
Store a Message:
Call storeMessage with a string message up to 100 characters.

solidity
Copy code
storeMessage("Welcome to decentralized storage!");
Retrieve the Message:
Call retrieveMessage to view your stored message.

solidity
Copy code
retrieveMessage(); // Output: "Welcome to decentralized storage!"
Security
Access Control: Only the message owner can retrieve their stored message.
Input Validation: The contract ensures that messages do not exceed 100 characters.
